Entry 07

Not much to report. Continuing to work hard. Been tough with a head cold I'm afraid I've come down with. 

On another note, in my free time, I am currently retaking several modules online that will help me with basic javascript, sql, and jquery. I am hoping that 301 will begin to click and I can start climing on board with it. There hasn't been much, if anything, that has made sense to me during 301.
