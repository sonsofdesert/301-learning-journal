Entry 2

Feeling very behind. I try to stay optimistic, however it is difficult. Not much to report again. Handlebar actually made some sense, which is good. 

Really tired of the terminal. I swear I do something one way, it works. Do it again, breaks everything and unbalances the universe. Pisses me off. 

End of report.
