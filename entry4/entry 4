Entry 4**

I've been going over some additional material to try and grasp the SQL and other concenpts. Not much is sticking, but I've decided I'm more comfortable in the front-end, haha. I am picking up bits and pieces of aspects of the backend, but not much.

I also have a hard time completing the readings. It's difficult to find a spare couple of hours to read several articles or chapters (let alone digest the material) during the day between jobs.
