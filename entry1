Entry 1:

Assignments have been fine. Nothing to really expound on. It is annoying when I am the Navigator trying to assist my partner and I have no clue what is happening. I speant my entire saturday sitting, twiddling my thumbs, becuase I couldn't help my partner try and figure out the code. Hopefully it gets better.
